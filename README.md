# Pi Web Space

A workspace-focused fork of [agegr/pi-web](https://github.com/agegr/pi-web), retaining its MIT license and upstream attribution.

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md) | [Русский](./README.ru.md)

Local browser UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Pi Web Space uses the same local configuration and session files as pi, so you can browse and resume conversations, run agent turns, configure models and resources, and inspect project files from a browser.


## What this fork adds

- Workspace and temporary-session selection, configurable temporary directories, and workspace/session detail cards with copy actions.
- Conversation, trace and context views; resizable chat width, file previews and a docked terminal.
- Session rounds, trace steps, token usage, cache hit rate, cost and estimated average output speed. `tok/s` includes tool/wait time in active duration; it is not pure model decoding throughput.
- Browser-local workspace naming, archives and appearance preferences; these preferences do not sync across devices.
- Settings → About links to this repository. Upstream update prompts are hidden until this fork has its own release flow.

## Features

- **Session workspace**: browse, resume, rename, export, and delete conversations grouped by project, with running state, context usage, cost, and compaction details.
- **Two ways to branch**: **New session** creates an independent session file from an earlier message; **Edit from here** creates a branch inside the current session.
- **Project file tools**: browse and upload files, inspect Git diffs, and preview source, Markdown, images, audio, PDFs, and DOCX files with automatic refresh.
- **Git worktrees**: switch checkouts from the sidebar while keeping sessions from the same repository grouped together.
- **Web-based configuration**: manage provider login and API keys, models, model tests, plugin packages, and skills without leaving Pi Web Space.
- **English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese UI**: Pi Web Space follows the browser language initially and provides a language switcher in the top bar.

## Quick Start

The npm package is prepared as `@wjbfks/pi-web-space` (first publication pending). Once published:

```bash
npm install -g @wjbfks/pi-web-space
pws
# Equivalent alias / 等效别名
pi-web-space
```

Requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Run this fork from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WJBFks/pi-atom-web.git
cd pi-atom-web
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:40141](http://127.0.0.1:40141).

Configure your provider in **Settings → Models**. The upstream npm package `@agegr/pi-web` does not install this fork. Environment variables and storage keys are retained for compatibility.

## Configuration

The primary command is `pws`; `pi-web-space` is an alias with identical options. Run `npm link` in this checkout to register both commands. Starting the server through the CLI requires a production build; keep using `npm run dev` during development.



The options below apply to the built checkout launcher (`pws`). Development uses port **40141**; `npm run dev:lan` enables LAN access.


For port and hostname, command-line options override the corresponding environment variables. Either `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` disables automatic browser opening. Run `pws --help` (or `-h`) to print startup options and exit without starting the server. Unknown options exit with an error.

| Option or environment variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--help`, `-h` | Print startup options and exit | — |
| `--port <port>`, `-p <port>`, or `PORT` | Server port | `40141` |
| `--hostname <host>`, `-H <host>`, or `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind hostname | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` | Do not open a browser automatically | Browser opens |
| `PI_WEB_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` | Disable the inherited upstream update API check | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Additional exact proxy or custom hostnames, comma-separated | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` | Enable browser password login; API clients may use Basic Auth with username `pi` | Authentication disabled |
| `PI_WEB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Session idle timeout in milliseconds, up to `2147483647`; `0` disables idle shutdown; invalid or out-of-range values use the default | `600000` (10 min) |

For example:

```bash
pws --help
pws -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0 --no-open
```

### Remote Access

Binding to a non-loopback address exposes an agent that can execute high-privilege actions. On a trusted LAN, require a long random password:

```bash
PI_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' pws --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

Password authentication does not encrypt the connection. Do not expose Pi Web Space over plain HTTP to the internet; use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN. If a reverse proxy sends an external hostname, add that exact name to `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. This allow-list does not change the address Pi Web Space binds to.

### HTTP Proxy

Server-side model and API requests honor the standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
npm run dev
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- **Agent data**: Pi Web Space reads pi data from `~/.pi/agent` by default, including session files under `sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to use another pi agent directory.
- **Filesystem access**: Pi Web Space must be able to read the agent data directory and the working directories recorded by its sessions. Run Pi Web Space in the same filesystem environment as pi when sharing existing sessions.
- **Shared configuration**: the Models panel uses pi's model, settings, and credential storage, so changes are visible to both interfaces.
- **File access boundary**: the file browser is limited to working directories selected in Pi Web Space and project or session roots it already knows about; it is not a general filesystem browser.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in Pi Web Space](./docs/worktrees.md) for switcher visibility, worktree creation, and removal behavior.

### Downstream Session Context Menu

Electron wrappers and other downstream integrations can provide a session-row
context menu without patching `SessionSidebar`. Listen for the cancelable
`pi-web:session-row-contextmenu` browser event and call `preventDefault()`
synchronously when the integration will handle it:

```js
window.addEventListener("pi-web:session-row-contextmenu", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY, refresh } = event.detail;

  void openSessionMenu({ id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY }).then((changed) => {
    if (changed) refresh();
  });
});
```

The detail object contains `id`, `path`, `cwd`, optional `name`, pointer
coordinates, and a `refresh()` callback for actions that change the session
list. If no listener cancels the extension event, Pi Web Space preserves the
browser's native context menu. This hook is browser-side and independent of
Pi agent extensions.

### Extension Session Liveness

Server-side Pi extensions with detached work can prevent automatic idle
session eviction through the versioned global registry:

```js
const liveness = globalThis[Symbol.for("@agegr/pi-web/session-liveness/v1")];
const release = liveness?.version === 1
  ? liveness.register({
      name: "my-extension",
      sessionId,
      sessionFile: sessionFile || undefined,
      isActive: () => detachedJobs.size > 0,
    })
  : () => {};
```

Register once per active extension session and call the returned idempotent
`release` function on session shutdown, replacement, or reload. `isActive`
must be synchronous, cheap, and scoped to the supplied exact session id or
file. Provider errors fail safe by preserving that session. This lease only
affects automatic idle eviction; explicit shutdown and Stop fallback cleanup
still take precedence.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:40141](http://127.0.0.1:40141). Run the common checks with:

```bash
npm test
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

Do not run `next build` or `npm run build` during normal development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the development server; leave builds for release work.
